Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in any way reasonably requested by the other Party to minimize the withholding tax implications of any such assignment or delegation. 8.3.3 Aimmune shall be responsible for all Value Added Taxes (\"VAT\"), if any, attributable to transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any offset or reimbursement from Xencor.

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification. 11.3.2 If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith. 11.3.3 The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. 35 Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020 11.3.4 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 11.4 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 11.1 or 11.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 12. 11.5 Insurance.

It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of Aimmune's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written evidence of such insurance prior to commencement of this Agreement and upon expiration of any one coverage. Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. 12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37 Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020 activities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.

Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security. 12.2 Publicity.

Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure. 12.3 Securities Filings.

Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things, notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party shall notify the other Party promptly in writing. 12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated [***].

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb(r)7195 from Xencor, Inc. XmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT(tm)) programs, including PALFORZIA(tm) , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies. \"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\" \"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\" Under the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones -- beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial -- and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months. About AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb(r)7195) AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020 in patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease. About Aimmune Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT(tm)) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies. For more information, please visit www.aimmune.com.

conditions of this agreement, or the requirements of any law or rule imposed by the u.s. securities and exchange commission or any securities exchange or other applicable law, but only to the extent of such necessity or requirements; and no such disclosure shall cause any such information to cease to be confidential information hereunder, except to the extent such disclosure results in a public disclosure of such information. where reasonably possible, the receiving party shall notify the disclosing party of the receiving party's intent to make such disclosure of confidential information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the confidential information. 12.1.3 except as set forth above, each party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to confidential information of the other party only to (i) the receiving party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial

tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws. 12.1.4 each party acknowledges that a party in breach of any of its obligations under this section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security. 12.2 publicity. promptly after the effective date, the parties shall each issue the applicable press release in the form attached hereto as schedule 12.2, with respect to this
